Chess Game in C (using SDL2)

A simple chess game built in C using SDL2 for graphics and input handling. 
It lets two players play chess on the same computer with a clean visual interface.
The project demonstrates basic game logic, board rendering, and event handling in SDL.
The input is in format "e2e4" in the terminal, where "cr" can be used to castle towards
the right and "cl" to castle towards left.
